### Installing the Wazuh manager
#### curling the install script and running it
`curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.9/wazuh-install.sh && sudo bash ./wazuh-install.sh -a`

```bash

Then we run a curl command to grab the installer shell file and run it with sudo

### Installing the Wazuh agent on a test machine

Our test agent machine will be a windows machine.
1. Install the Wazuh agent software on the windows machine
2. Set up the connection with the Wazuh server and starting the service
#### Installing the Wazuh agent
1. First we will need to download theÂ [Windows installer](https://packages.wazuh.com/4.x/windows/wazuh-agent-4.9.0-1.msi).

2. Following the Wazuh documentation we simply run the [Windows installer](https://packages.wazuh.com/4.x/windows/wazuh-agent-4.9.0-1.msi), then select a configuration method(CLI/GUI)(Both methods need administrator privilege's).
	- CLI method.
		Using CMD
		`wazuh-agent-4.9.0-1.msi /q WAZUH_MANAGER="192.168.64.134"`
		Or powershell
		`.\wazuh-agent-4.9.0-1.msi /q WAZUH_MANAGER="192.168.64.134"`
		Then after Installing Wazuh with either of the commands we run the service with the following respectively, In CMD we use
		`NET START Wazuh`
		and for powershell we use
		`start-service wazuh`
	- GUI method.
		When setting up the [Windows installer](https://packages.wazuh.com/4.x/windows/wazuh-agent-4.9.0-1.msi) we are prompt to choose if we want to use the GUI, so we simply check it or we run the Wazuh agent app.

		![Wazuh GUI](images/Wazuh%20GUI.png)

		Inside the app we simply add the Wazuh server ip, save and start the service, all from within the GUI

## Basic configuration

Now that both our Server and test machine are setup we should access the Wazuh interface through a browser, using the server machine we simply use `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` which are loopback addresses, the Wazuh service is using the `443` Port so we simply go to the localhost address without specifying the port as it is the default for https, it will give a security warning as we don't have a certificate.
![Wazuh Security Warning](images/Wazuh_sec_warn.png)

We accept the risk and continue from the advanced button, after all it is our service.
Then we enter the admin and password that we got from the installer earlier to login.
![Wazuh Login](images/Wazuh_login.png)

We should change the password after the first login.
After we login wazuh checks if there are any errors in the initialization.
![Wazuh Check](images/Wazuh_check.png)

Then we are taken to the overview page, where we can see an overview of most of the main functionality of this SIEM software

### Configuring the dashboards and alerts for real time threat detection
#### Creating a simple dashboard
Navigate to the explore tab through the sidebar and click on dashboard
![Wazuh Dashboard](images/wazuh_dashboard.png)

Click create new to add objects to the dashboard as needed

![Wazuh Create Dashboard](images/wazuh_dashboard_create_new.png)

I will be creating a simple dashboad containing some of the vulnerabilities currently in my agents, agents resource usage and active agents

#### Setting up alerts

1. Navigate to Notifications tab to set up our alerting notification(mail/slack/etc).
![Wazuh Notification Sidebar](images/wazuh_notification_sidebar.png)

2. I have setup an email notifier 
![Wazuh Notification Channels](images/wazuh_notification_channels.png)

3. Then we go to the alerts tab
![Wazuh Alerts Sidebar](images/Wazuh_alerts_sidebar.png)

4. In the monitoring tab, we can create a job that monitors a certain condition, when met it will trigger the notification we just setup.
![Wazuh Monitors](images/wazuh_monitors.png)

5. The condition for this monitoring job is security alerts like port scanning, unauthorized admin privilege's, unusual traffic at times of usually very low traffic like 2am, unusual resource usage and a lot more.
6. We can test the alerting system by triggering some triggers manually to check that the alerts are working as expected.
